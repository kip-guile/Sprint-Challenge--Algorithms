#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n2), Exponential time - The first line contains a while loop which goes on for n _ n _ n times. O(n3). Inside the loop, the next line is O(1), constant time, so we represent the pseudocode with the worst case, which is O(n3), represented as O(n2)

b)
O(n2), Exponential time - The first for loop goes on for n times. Inside the loop, the next line is an O(1). However, it has a nested while loop which goes on for n times as well. Therefore, n \* n = n2 . The running time will be O(n2)

c)
O(n), Linear time. The pseudocode contains an assignment which is O(1). It also contains a recursive call which will go on until the size of the input decreases to 0. Therefore it is O(n).
